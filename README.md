# Willy-List
Web app for making lists quickly. Users have two options: The first is to create a quicklist which is meant to be an expendable, throwaway list. The second is to make a Willylist, a list meant to be bookmarked for long-term usage. Willylists are created with an email address, so if a user forgets/misplaces their assigned Willylist url, they will be able to recover their Willylist by association. 

## How To Install In a Windows Environment
```
git clone https://github.com/wilfredogaldamez/Willy-List/
cd Willy-List
pip -r install requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Usage
Navigate to a localhost:8000 on a browser and select Quicklist or Willylist. 

## WIP
Adding the functionality for the user to recover a Willylist given their email address.
